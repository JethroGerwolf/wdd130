        Hopeful Ranch is all done on horseback. We raise longhorns and we have 200 acres of land. We mainly use quarter horses but we also have some Arabs. We enjoy long days in the saddle and camping under the stars when it comes to herding season. We also have a small garden that we take care of in our free time. It is full of potatoes, corn, onions, and tomatoes. This help provides for our needs. We also grow alfalfa in a couple of pastors to help supply the cow in the winter. 
      </p>
      <p>Our family has own this ranch for only 9 year and we still have so much to learn.

      <h3>How we started</h3>
      <h1>How we started </p1>
        <p>We started in the summer of 2014. The main driving force for this change was I lost my job and have no way to do it. I used to install satellites but the company went under so I looked for something to do and a good friend from church offered that we start ranching. So that is exactly what we did. It was a massive change of life. I am thankful that my friend helped us along the path and now I can't imagine living any other way.
      </p>
      <h1>Starting Ranch</h1>
      <p>Our ranch started out as only 100 areas and 5 horses all quarter horses. From there we went to the auction where with the help of our dear friends we bought 50 head. That was everything we had. We now have 100-125 head a year that we raise a year. We also now have 200 acres.</p>
      <h1>Warning</h1>
      <p>Of course this is all fake and has little to no substance. This is just for a homework assignment of making a website not a ranching class or I would have failed it.</p>
