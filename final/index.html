        <p>Hopeful Ranch is all done on horseback. We raise longhorns and we have 200 acres of land. We mainly use quarter horses but we also have some Arabs. We enjoy long days in the saddle and camping under the stars when it comes to herding season. We also have a small garden that we take care of in our free time. It is full of potatoes, corn, onions, and tomatoes. This help provides for our needs. We also grow alfalfa in a couple of pastors to help supply the cow in the winter.</p>
